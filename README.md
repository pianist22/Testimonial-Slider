# Testimonial Slider - React Project

Welcome to Testimonial Slider, my second React project created under the guidance of [Love Babbar](https://github.com/loveBabbar). This project showcases testimonials from different individuals working in an organization. It features a simple slider interface with left and right shift buttons to navigate through the testimonials. Additionally, there is a "Surprise Me" button that randomly generates testimonials.

## Features

- **Testimonial Slider**: Users can navigate through different testimonials using the left and right shift buttons.

- **Random Testimonial Generator**: The "Surprise Me" button generates a random testimonial, adding an element of surprise and variety to the user experience.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd testimonial-slider
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
